Comprehensive Workflows (ZTEM)
==============================


This workflow is organized as follows:

.. toctree::

    - Understanding ZTEM anomalies from compact conductors, compact resistors and the impact of layered structures <1_basic_anomalies>
    - Loading geophysical data and transforming from along-line cross-line convention to GIF convention <2_load_data>
    - Assigning uncertainties to ZTEM data <3_uncertainties>
    - Preparing data for inversion <4_data_preparation>
    - Mesh design in extreme topography regions <5_mesh_design>
    - Performing the inversion <6_inversion>
    - Convergence and data misfit <7_convergence>
    - Final model and interpretation <8_interpretation>
