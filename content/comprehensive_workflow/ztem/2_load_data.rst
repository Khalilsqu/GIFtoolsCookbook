Loading and Transforming Field Data into GIF Convention
=======================================================

The first step in any project is to load field collected data and visualize it. ZTEM datasets are challenging to work with for several reasons. First, ZTEM data are computed by applying a non-trivial operation to the components of the measured magnetic fields. Second, the ZTEM data values are frequently represented in a survey-dependent coordinate system.

Here, we will assume that you have some XYZ formatted ZTEM data. The goal is to transform these data into UBC-GIF format so that we can eventually invert them. Using contractor information and GIFtools, we will show how this is possible.

.. important:: Requires GIFtools v2.30 or later.

Starting Your Project
---------------------

    - Open GIFtools
    - :ref:`Set the working directory <projSetWorkDir>`


Import Files
------------

.. note:: If you do not have Geosoft XYZ formatted data from which to work with, you may `download practice data <https://github.com/ubcgif/GIFtoolsCookbook/raw/master/assets/AtoZ_e3dmt_4Download.zip>`_ . It is from this dataset that we will demonstrate the workflow.

Here, we import the ZTEM data and topography.

    - :ref:`Import topography data (XYZ format) <importTopo>`. The data file is named *ZTEMtopo.xyz* and is in the *assets* folder.

    - :ref:`Import ZTEM data from Geosoft XYZ <importXYZemData>`. The data file is named *ZTEMdata_XYZ.dat* and is in the *assets* folder. If you are using the practice data:

        - We are loading data at 5 frequencies: 30, 45, 90, 180 and 360 Hz. The 720 Hz data were considered poor quality.
        - There are 4 data groups (TZXR, TZXI, TZYR, TZYI)
        - Within *ZTEMdata_XYZ.dat*, we are loading the final set of columns: XIP_xxxHz, XQd_xxxHz, YIP_xxxHz and YQd_xxxHz.
        - Make sure you load the *Bearing* column as well!

    - Once loaded, make sure to :ref:`set IO headers <objectSetioHeaders>` for all ZTEM tipper data.

    - **Pro tip:** To avoid confusion between location and data coordinate systems, use the :ref:`set data headers <objectDataHeaders>` tool to define location columns as *Easting, Northing* and *Elevation*.



Determining Data Convention
---------------------------

Now that we have loaded the XYZ data file and set the IO headers, we can take a first look at our data. By looking at the raw data and using any contractor information we can determine:

    1) the coordinate system in which our data are being represented
    2) the transformation required to go from the raw data coordinate system to UBC-GIF

Some things to consider when examining your dataset may include:

    - Any information about data convention provided by the contractor. This is the most important.
    - If the data values collected along different flight line directions do not match up at the same locations.
    - If the shape of the Tzx anomaly over a known conductor or resistor lines up with the flight direction. Recall the :ref:`anomaly over a compact conductor <comprehensive_workflow_ztem_1_conductor>` .

The real and imaginary components of the raw Tipper data provided are plotted below. Below, we see that data collected Southwest to Northeast and data collected Northeast to Southwest are very different at similar locations. This indicates the data coordinates are dependent on flight direction.

    Raw ZTEM data (TZXR, TZXI, TZYR and TZYI) at 180 Hz. Figure shows that Southwest to Northeast line data and Northwest to Southeast line data are not collected in the same coordinate system.

Below, we see the convention for data collection provided by the contractor. Flying Southwest to Northeast (bearing = 45 degrees), our Re[Tzx] anomaly would be positive to the Southwest of a conductor and negative to the Northeast. Flying Northwest to Southeast (bearing = 135 degrees), our Re[Tzx] anomaly would be positive to the Northwest and negative to the Southeast. The plot indicates that the cross-line direction is 90 degrees counter clockwise from the along-line direction. The plot also indicates the Z is +ve upwards.

Transformation to UBC GIF Coordinates
-------------------------------------

According to the contractor information, we must apply the following transformations to the ZTEM data provided:

    - Data collected along Southwest to Northeast must be rotated counter clockwise by 45 degrees. And data collected along Southwest to Northeast must be rotated counter clockwise by 135 degrees.
    - We must transform from the cross-line direction to being 90 degrees clockwise from the along-line direction instead of 90 degrees counter clockwise.
    - We must transform from z +ve upward to z +ve downward.

To apply this transformation, we use the following utility:

    - :ref:`ZTEM data transformation <objectDataManipulationZTEM_transform>`. The XYZ file has a column which provides the along-line direction for each datum.

Tipper data after applying the transformation is shown below. X and Y are now the Northing and Easting directions, respectively, and Z is positive downward. This is the UBC-GIF convention. The data map indicates a possible conductor in the region near (273000, 6245000).
